# lucysfamily
this is a Object-Oriented Java programm called "Lucysfamily".
I just started learning java,just start learning Object-Oriented.i wanna do something interesting.
I learn java mostly on a website called codeacademy(of course i also take course at Uni but i don't think it's very helpful cause i mostly learn programming with english. )this Dog file is a chapter from codeacademy java tutorial,i followed instruction write codes by myself without looking answer in the website,then i add sth on my own like "the pet Spicies".my problem is i wanna add dog's gender(by using enum),but i don't know how to let computer choose its gender from "Male" or "Female".
why this repository called "Lucysfamily"?cause i wanna use Object-Oriented to create a family,a dog is also a member of this family,so i start with a dog,i'll add more things on dog make it more lively and continue writing code about other family member(parents,lucy,lucy's brothers...)to improve and correct my Object-Oriented skills.
this repository is pretty boring i know,but it helps me learn java better.
